It is a function that has no name and uses a functional approach to execute code.
the lambda expression is also known as an anonymous function.

() -> System.out.println("executing lambda expression."); // zero argument, lambda expression

(String str) -> System.out.print(str); // single argumment, lambda expression

(int a, int b) -> a+b; // multiple arguments, sum of two values

(a,b) -> a+b // parameters without types, can be used to sum and concat two strings as well.

(int a, int b) -> return (a+b); // lambda expression with return statement

(int[]) -> { multiple statments; return index; }   // it can have multiple statements
